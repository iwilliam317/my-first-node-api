# my-first-node-api

My first Node API simulates a communication between differents applications and their format content. It helps to understant how content negotiation actually works on NodeJs.

The server-side application is prepared to respond in different formats (html and json), and the client-side application will request an appropriate content.

1. Access the 'servidor' folder and then, run:
``` nodemon app ```

2. Access 'cliente' folder and then, run:
``` node android.js  ```
